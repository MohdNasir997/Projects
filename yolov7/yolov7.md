This repository represents all my projects done in **YOLOv7** .

**Aerial footage of airport** : this project uses aerial footage of airports to identify planes  

parked in the airport and in the runway.

**Football players detection** : this project uses images of football matches to train a Yolov7 model to identify football players in the field.

**Building detection via satelite images** : this project uses images of buildings taken from satelite to train a model to identify such buildings.
