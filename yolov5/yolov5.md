This repository is here to showcase my YOLOv5 projects:

**Construction site detection** : this projects trains a YOLOv5 model to detect safety gear worn by construction workers and machinary lying around the site.

**Face detection** : this project uses images of people face to train a model to detect the faces of people in the images containing people.
